	A while ago, I discovered the concept of the Indie Web, probably via some Hacker News article. I liked this idea of having my own little space somewhere on the internet, where I can make something that shows people who I am and what I like. I just did not think this would be something I would ever do.

        Since reading this article I have started to think more about this idea, finding more and more stuff I could put on my site. Eventually I decided to at least try a small site with Github Pages.

      But then I discovered Neocities. This seemed like a way better fit. And all the other websites Neocities inspired me even more. And to my surprise a colleague of mine already had a <a class="thunderwaregames" href="//thunderwaregames.neocities.org/">Neocities page</a>!
