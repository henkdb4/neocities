      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Henk and I am a software engineer living in the Netherlands.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website will contain all kinds of stuff I'm interested about. Which means propably a lot of technology stuff. I am also DMin g a D&D Campain so I might add somne D&D Stuff I found or created.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, I like to tinker, so this website will also serve as a playground for some web projects I want to experiment with.
      </p>


      <h2>Why I started with this website.</h2>
      <p>
	A while ago, I discovered the concept of the Indie Web, probably via some Hacker News article. I liked this idea of having my own little space somewhere on the internet, where I can make something that shows people who I am and what I like. I just did not think this would be something I would ever do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since reading this article I have started to think more about this idea, finding more and more stuff I could put on my site. Eventually I decided to at least try a small site with Github Pages.
      </p>
      <p>
      But then I discovered Neocities. This seemed like a way better fit. And all the other websites Neocities inspired me even more. And to my surprise a colleague of mine already has a <a class="thunderwaregames" href="//thunderwaregames.neocities.org/">Neocities page</a>!
