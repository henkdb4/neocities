          Hi, my name is Henk and I am a software engineer living in the Netherlands.  
        </p>
        <p>
          This website will contain all kinds of stuff I'm interested about. Which means propably a lot of technology stuff. I am also DMin g a D&D Campain so I might add some D&D Stuff I found or created.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, I like to tinker, so this website will also serve as a playground for some web projects I want to experiment with.

      <h2 class="neon">Why I started with this website</h2>
      <div class="cyber">
        <p>
        A while ago, I discovered the concept of the Indie Web or the <a class="neon-select small-web" href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/">Small web</a>, probably via some Hacker News article. I liked this idea of having my own little space somewhere on the internet, where I can make something that shows people who I am and what I like. I just did not think this would be something I would ever do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since reading this article I have started to think more about this idea, finding more and more stuff I could put on my site. Eventually I decided to at least try a small site with Github Pages.
        </p>
        <p>
        But then I discovered Neocities. This seemed like a way better fit. And all the other websites Neocities inspired me even more. And to my surprise a colleague of mine already has a <a class="neon-select thunderwaregames" href="//thunderwaregames.neocities.org/">Neocities page</a>!
